# It is recommended that you use the require(assetId) version instead of BloxCordAPI Module. It will be auto updated and you won't have to do anything.
### Use this to require it:
```lua
local BloxCord = require(4764326346)
BloxCord.login(API KEY, TOKEN)
```
##### ApiKey and Token can be retrieved by asking staff in our [official discord server](https://discord.gg/xaCZs4E)
